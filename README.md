Given a list of users, build a users data table that displays users in a paginated format.

## Requirements
### Table requirements
- The users data table should display the following columns: Id, Name, Age, Occupation
- Each row in the table represents a single user
### Pagination requirements
- The pagination controls should allow the user to navigate to previous and next pages
- The pagination controls should display the current page number and the total number of pages
- The table should update dynamically when the user navigates to a different page
- Provide an option to select the number of users displayed per page (e.g., 5, 10, 20)

### Sorting requirements
- Allow sorting by a specific column by clicking on the table header. The data will be sorted by the selected column in ascending order (default).
- Clicking on the header of the table that is already sorted by that column will toggle the sorting order between ascending and descending.
